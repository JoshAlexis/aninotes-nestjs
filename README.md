# Aninotes 

This a new version of the unfinished project [Aninotes](git@github.com:JoshAlexis/aninotes-nestjs.git).

## About Aninotes

Aninotes it's a simple app to save information about Pixiv artists, also about illustrators from other platforms as Devinart, arstation, etc.

The origin of this project was to practice the knowledges from my university classes (MySQL, Java and then PHP).

The first version was made in Java with MySQL.

The second version was using PHP.

## Current status

The actual version was made using ReactJS and NodeJS with MongoDB. This version is available to 
[visit](https://aninotes.netlify.app/).

The backend is hosted en Heroku, the frontend in Netlify and for the database I used the free tier of Mongo Atlas.
